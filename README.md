[Chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(peer-to-peer)) is an algorithm for peer-to-peer distributed hash tables that make key-value pairs accessible to any peer in the network. To help visualize the Chord protocol, Chordgen generates a DHT diagram for fixed values of *m*. It shows finger tables for every peer and allows users to add or remove peers from the network. In addition, Chordgen lets users lookup values from a peer and shows the search path for content.
